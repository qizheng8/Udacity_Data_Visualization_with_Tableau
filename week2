know how to design!

1.choose right chart:
visual encodings + data types + relationship = chart type!

2.When you are comparing groups, bar charts are typically the best choice

3.show actual values for your data, a table will work great. include color and formatting (bold/italics) to emphasize what you want the viewer to understand form the table.

4.Geospatial data (country, state, latititude and longitude) is readily viewed on a map. 

5.As mentioned above, a map with colors encoding data is called a choropleth

6.A cartogram distorts regions in the map to indicate some variable such as population or gross national product.

7.A small multiple is a series of plots with the same scale that make it simple to compare data across groups. The plots can be practically anything: lines, bars,scatter plots, maps.

8.Ploy.ly: it's a language for data visualization

9.Visualizing Distributions: Histograms, Box plots, strip charts (Strip charts display the actual data for each group as dots), violin plots (Violin plots display a smoothed distribution of the data. The distribution is approximated using a method called kernel density estimation.)

10.A color palette is the range of colors used to encode the data values.

11.Our eyes are more sensitive to green than red, and more sensitive to red than blue.

12.linear luminance palettes:Sequential palettes and 

13.Sequential palettes have a smooth transition from light to dark or dark to light.

14.Diverging palettes transition from one color to another, passing through a light (or dark) color with the luminance shifting linearly through the palette

15.consider black and white; then think about using natual color; don't use random colors and bright colors; use color to highlight
