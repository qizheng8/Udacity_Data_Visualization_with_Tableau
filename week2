know how to design!

1.choose right chart:
visual encodings + data types + relationship = chart type!

2.When you are comparing groups, bar charts are typically the best choice

3.show actual values for your data, a table will work great. include color and formatting (bold/italics) to emphasize what you want the viewer to understand form the table.

4.Geospatial data (country, state, latititude and longitude) is readily viewed on a map. 

5.As mentioned above, a map with colors encoding data is called a choropleth

6.A cartogram distorts regions in the map to indicate some variable such as population or gross national product.

7.A small multiple is a series of plots with the same scale that make it simple to compare data across groups. The plots can be practically anything: lines, bars,scatter plots, maps.

8.Ploy.ly: it's a language for data visualization

9.Visualizing Distributions: Histograms, Box plots, strip charts (Strip charts display the actual data for each group as dots), violin plots (Violin plots display a smoothed distribution of the data. The distribution is approximated using a method called kernel density estimation.)
